			<p>I believe my role as an educator is to guide and nurture the next generation to establish skills to achieve health, respect, prosperity and fulfillment.

I am passionate about students being empowered to succeed. As Principal, I use all tools available to inspire staff, students and community to work together to promote student achievement and well-being.  

I am an avid supporter of effective and innovative professional development that encourages teachers and principals to be reflective and to continuously examine our practice to provide quality teaching and learning for each student. My role as Principal is to keep up with latest trends and research and be an active partner in the school's professional development.

The ability to be innovative and creative is important to me. I enjoy being challenged and inspired by the people around me. I aim to enthuse and challenge staff and students to also be inventive and imaginative in their learning and day to day tasks.

I believe that having quality, inspirational and passionate teachers is essential to a school's success. To borrow John Hattie's words; "teachers should build classroom climates where errors are welcome, student engagement is the norm, questioning is high and students gain reputations as effective learners." 

I enjoy celebrating successes and acknowledge hard work of staff, students and community and believe this is one of the contributors fundamental to a happy school environment. All staff, students and community should feel valued and appreciated at school. 

Community engagement and involvement in the school is important to me as Principal. I regularly consult with my community as part of school self review and encourage community engagement in the curriculum and learning programmes.</p>
